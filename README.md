Toy Robot Simulator Solution
============================

Description
-----------

This toy application is a solution to rea-robot and is created by Chi(Andy) Wang (climber2002@gmail.com). The ruby version is at [here](https://github.com/climber2002/rea-robot) and this time I will solve it using Scala especially cats using a pure functional way. Check the PROBLEM.md for the exercise description.
